# Fast VR setup for Godot

(DISCLAIMER: we assume you are in the Faculty, so everything we need is supposed to be installed)


### First

We need to plug the VR Headset to the PC with the corresponding cable

### Second

Open Meta Horizon Link on the PC

### Third

With your VR Headset on, click on quicksettings --> link and select the PC (launch)

### Fourth

Find Godot on the PC and run it (we use the last stable version)

### Fifth (extra)

When you first run a project (debbuging), it may appear a message on the VR Headset like "do you want to debbug with this visor?", just click on allow

### Congrats!! You are now able to execute VR projects on the headset

You are now free to explore, for example, some of the projects other people have done in the class
